This means more C in the atmosphere that can warm the climate more. Others, correct me if I misinterpreted that.\n",

      "10:02:09\t From  Merritt Turetsky (she/her) : Something that is important to clarify is that northern fires certainly burn fuels in vegetation (such as in the trees) but MOST of what burns in these fires is actually on the ground.  Moss and peat (organic and thus carbon rich soils) is fueling these fires.  How much peat is consumed dictates post-fire plant recovery.  So these are interesting interactions between fire, soils, and vegetation\n",

      "10:12:04\t From  Merritt Turetsky (she/her) : Randi just asked me individually if Alaska actually has true peatlands.  It is a good question!  Let me explain.  Peatlands are defined as ecosystems that have accumulated at least 40cm of peat.  Peatlands include bogs (rain fed systems) and fens (influenced by surface mineral and groundwater flow).\n",
      "\n",
      "10:12:33\t From  Randi Jandt : Exciting concept about the structual changes and reduced fire feedbacks Brian.  Could be somewhat explanatory to paleoecological findings of frequent fire in interior AK in previous warmer climates in AK.\n",

      "\n",
      "10:13:37\t From  Merritt Turetsky (she/her) : Does Alaska have true peatlands.  Yes for sure.  They are not mapped that well and they tend to be thinner in peat thickness than in Canada.  But they are out there.  At the same time, Alaska has wonderful examples of ecosystems with a huge range of peat thickness from thin to thick.  It’s all a grand soil gradient!\n",
      "\n",
      "10:13:58\t From  Randi Jandt : Taiga/tundra of southwestern AK should border on the definition of \"peatland\" then, but I still don't have a good idea of the extent. Matt Macander?\n",
      "\n",
      "10:14:05\t From  Helene Genet : Looking at OL thickness across the landscape with associated soil moisture and soil temperature, I think the definition of peatland with only OL thickness is rather limiting.\n",
      "\n",
      "10:14:28\t From  Merritt Turetsky (she/her) : Michelle - yes to fibric being included.  Poorly decomposed moss is mostly what comprises boreal peat.\n",

      "\n",
      "10:15:49\t From  Merritt Turetsky (she/her) : Helene - that is the definition though according to wetland classification schemes. I am not beholden to wetland classification schemes, but that is what we use!  Peatlands often function similar to forests, so I am not surprised by your last comment!  Peatlands as wetlands or peatlands as forests?????\n",

      "10:55:53\t From  Merritt Turetsky (she/her) : Christa - I was part of a working group that thought about the evolution of flammability traits and bryophytes were pretty important to that story.  This was more global, but it would be awesome to drill into northern plants (vasc + nonvasc).\n",

      "\n",
      "10:58:12\t From  Mary Beth Leigh : Nitrogen is a limiting nutrient for plant growth in the boreal forest ecosystem. Jay Jones’ group is seeing that lots of N is flowing into streams and then being lost from the ecosystem as it washes away. Microbes may be converted dead organics into soluble forms of N that wash away. Thawing permafrost may be helping this happen in a larger quantity of soil.\n",

      "11:00:31\t From  Christa Mulder : Following up on Mary Beth: Nitrogen is a very big deal because it is limiting to almost every species: plants, animals, fungi, bacteria... they all need it to make protein and other components that are critical to life. The exception is bacteria that can take N out of the air, where it is very abundant. So any time there is a shift in where N goes, it matters. \n",

      "11:00:37\t From  Merritt Turetsky (she/her) : Michelle that is actually a really interesting analogy.  I am interested in these subsurface changes and important they are to surface processes.  This is sort of a test of our connectivity hypothesis.  I wonder if there are other examples….?\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "11:01:28\t From  Teresa Hollingsworth : Christa- YES! The phenology part is my “future” thinking. And it would be great to think more about life history traits of the two species we looked at. We looked at Vaculi and Hylocomium and measured traits across a variety of sites and then linked them to environmental gradients\n",

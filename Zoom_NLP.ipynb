       "'09:01:43\\t From  Roger Ruess   to   Jason Downing(Privately) : Hey Jason - how do we get rid of than annoying bell?? thanks\\n09:02:02\\t From  Rebecca B Neumann   to   Jason Downing(Privately) : Hi Jason! I am curious about the lightening talks. Am I giving a talk this morning?\\n09:02:28\\t From  Teresa Hollingsworth   to   Jason Downing(Privately) : If you want to send me a link for the speed talks that would be awesome. But I don’t need to give a talk… There are A LOT of talks and it will already take way way too long.\\n09:02:45\\t From  Jason Downing : http://www.lter.uaf.edu/sympo/2020/SpeedTalksBattingOrder_2020-11-16.pdf\\n09:05:17\\t From  Merritt Turetsky (she/her) : Awesome.  Welcome talented artists!  We are happy you are here.\\n09:05:30\\t From  Theresa Woldstad : Thank you for having us!\\n09:16:55\\t From  Jason Downing   to   Jay Jones(Privately) : are you presenting Rogers slides or is he?\\n09:30:28\\t From  mark waldrop : Can we see the entire order? (I”ll need to run to another meeting from 10-11 ak time)\\n09:30:42\\t From  mark waldrop : I see it\\n09:31:16\\t From  Jay Jones : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hWJTM6cgUi2sRjPH27gLqbcdOQdoHALX/edit#gid=1513251827\\n09:31:24\\t From  Jay Jones : Grand Challenges\\n09:31:54\\t From  Jay Jones : Materials for Day 1\\n09:31:55\\t From  Jay Jones : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e9v9tdhb6qBGoSbxFWw4hAqpQSy9hHTT\\n09:38:05\\t From  Merritt Turetsky (she/her) : Happy moss!\\n09:38:13\\t From  Mary Beth Leigh : :)\\n09:38:24\\t From  William Cox : :)\\n09:38:37\\t From  Moss (Jen) : :)\\n09:39:26\\t From  Helene Genet : Yes Tamara! Lets talk more about the N-climate feedback!\\n09:44:51\\t From  Merritt Turetsky (she/her) : The old adage is that deciduous stands don’t burn severely but Mike Flannigan talks frequently about how this “legacy” will not continue in a warmer future.\\n09:45:39\\t From  Brian Buma : I imagine it won\\'t.  we have data from reburned deciduous stands (interval about 15 years or so).  accepted in ecosphere, should be out in a month or so.  Katherine Hayes lead author\\n09:47:40\\t From  Merritt Turetsky (she/her) : Thanks Brian!  Look forward to reading that!\\n09:48:09\\t From  Mary Beth Leigh : For people unfamiliar with this topic, most trees require a symbiotic fungus associated with their roots to survive. The type of fungus can affect how successful the tree is.\\n09:50:54\\t From  Jessie Robertson : It would be interesting to see if there is a relationship between fungal associations and water uptake\\n09:51:59\\t From  Jessie Robertson : there is a lot of reverse flow from the trees that likely alters soil moisture in the root system\\n09:55:10\\t From  Mary Beth Leigh : In simple terms (I think), soil organic matter is important for storing carbon that would otherwise be in the atmosphere. When there are frequent fires, Shabaga et. al are finding that microbes are decomposing that carbon more - and other unknowns are also causing the C to be lost to the atmosphere. This means more C in the atmosphere that can warm the climate more. Others, correct me if I misinterpreted that.\\n09:56:07\\t From  Christa Mulder : I love your \"translations\", Mary Beth! \\n09:56:51\\t From  Mary Beth Leigh : Thanks! Everyone is invited to help. And, please ask questions if you’re feeling lost!\\n10:00:01\\t From  Brody Lane Shappell : Indeed- thanks for the translations! \\n10:00:08\\t From  Merritt Turetsky (she/her) : Mary Beth, we are starting to refer to these feedback loops as “vicious cycles” and both fire and permafrost thaw are good examples.\\n10:02:09\\t From  Merritt Turetsky (she/her) : Something that is important to clarify is that northern fires certainly burn fuels in vegetation (such as in the trees) but MOST of what burns in these fires is actually on the ground.  Moss and peat (organic and thus carbon rich soils) is fueling these fires.  How much peat is consumed dictates post-fire plant recovery.  So these are interesting interactions between fire, soils, and vegetation\\n10:02:31\\t From  Mary Beth Leigh : Landsat is the use of satellite imagery to gather data. Here, it’s being used to characterize changes in the boreal forest over time. A sort of storytelling, perhaps?\\n10:04:15\\t From  Mary Beth Leigh : Future scenarios development is a scientific tool for predicting the future based on info from the  past.\\n10:06:43\\t From  Helene Genet : Yes - model inter-comparison would be really interesting on these questions of attribution.\\n10:08:00\\t From  Merritt Turetsky (she/her) : To all the fire and scenario folks on this call, is anyone thinking about scenario development for changing fire on peatlands?  It is happening at the same time but I don’t see many people working their way through this.  Just curious!\\n10:08:28\\t From  Michelle Cailin Mack : We need to tackle this!\\n10:09:17\\t From  Merritt Turetsky (she/her) : Great!\\n10:09:50\\t From  Tamara Harms (she/her) : Merritt: can you define peatlands here please?\\n10:11:03\\t From  msluc : No, but it would be great.  We are working on uplands. I think models don\\'t do a great job with peatlands, IMO.\\n10:12:04\\t From  Merritt Turetsky (she/her) : Randi just asked me individually if Alaska actually has true peatlands.  It is a good question!  Let me explain.  Peatlands are defined as ecosystems that have accumulated at least 40cm of peat.  Peatlands include bogs (rain fed systems) and fens (influenced by surface mineral and groundwater flow).\\n10:12:33\\t From  Randi Jandt : Exciting concept about the structual changes and reduced fire feedbacks Brian.  Could be somewhat explanatory to paleoecological findings of frequent fire in interior AK in previous warmer climates in AK.\\n10:12:51\\t From  Michelle Cailin Mack : Do you include fabric in the 40 cm of peat?\\n10:13:04\\t From  Teresa Hollingsworth   to   Jason Downing(Privately) : I uploaded my talk :)\\n10:13:22\\t From  Michelle Cailin Mack : The should have been “fibric” as in the less decomposed layer about humic\\n10:13:37\\t From  Merritt Turetsky (she/her) : Does Alaska have true peatlands.  Yes for sure.  They are not mapped that well and they tend to be thinner in peat thickness than in Canada.  But they are out there.  At the same time, Alaska has wonderful examples of ecosystems with a huge range of peat thickness from thin to thick.  It’s all a grand soil gradient!\\n10:13:58\\t From  Randi Jandt : Taiga/tundra of southwestern AK should border on the definition of \"peatland\" then, but I still don\\'t have a good idea of the extent. Matt Macander?\\n10:14:05\\t From  Helene Genet : Looking at OL thickness across the landscape with associated soil moisture and soil temperature, I think the definition of peatland with only OL thickness is rather limiting.\\n10:14:28\\t From  Merritt Turetsky (she/her) : Michelle - yes to fibric being included.  Poorly decomposed moss is mostly what comprises boreal peat.\\n10:14:49\\t From  Helene Genet : A lot of the sites I’m looking at have thick organic layers with hydrological regimes that are more similar to uplands than lowland/peatland\\n10:15:49\\t From  Merritt Turetsky (she/her) : Helene - that is the definition though according to wetland classification schemes. I am not beholden to wetland classification schemes, but that is what we use!  Peatlands often function similar to forests, so I am not surprised by your last comment!  Peatlands as wetlands or peatlands as forests?????\\n10:15:49\\t From  Michelle Cailin Mack : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CNLFGgN28phnHC7nN7lZd1uOPwMwGckLqATgSLoh32s/edit?usp=sharing\\n10:16:34\\t From  William Cox : Is it more of a gradient than a clear cut category? re: peatland systems\\n10:17:14\\t From  Merritt Turetsky (she/her) : Will - yes I definitely think this way!\\n10:17:35\\t From  Helene Genet : Models don’t deal well with gradients …\\n10:47:29\\t From  Roger Ruess   to   Jason Downing(Privately) : yeah, helplessly I don\\'t see that\\n10:48:11\\t From  Merritt Turetsky (she/her) : For anyone interested in zombie fires, here is an illustration that may be of interest!  https://twitter.com/zodpaint/status/1328368171154239492\\n10:48:34\\t From  Roger Ruess   to   Jason Downing(Privately) : not a crisis\\n10:48:48\\t From  Jason Downing   to   Roger Ruess(Privately) : sorry, there are lots of view modes so hard to know what you are seeing\\n10:50:30\\t From  Mary Beth Leigh : Great zombie fire figure! Thanks, Merritt!\\n10:50:39\\t From  Alison York : Randi put together a great story about the “zombie” fires of 1942 in Alaska with climate input from Rick Thomas: https://akfireconsortium.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/afsc_rb_2020_1.pdf\\n10:51:17\\t From  Merritt Turetsky (she/her) : So awesome Alison.  And Randi!\\n10:51:42\\t From  Alison York : Thoman\\n10:53:31\\t From  Merritt Turetsky (she/her) : Another grand challenge raised by Teresa.  How can information on good fire help us prevent bad fire?\\n10:54:07\\t From  Christa Mulder : Teresa and Emilia, I would love to chat more about plant life history strategies and phenology and how it relates to flammability.\\n10:54:27\\t From  Jason Downing   to   glennjuday(Privately) : are you back?\\n10:54:39\\t From  Mary Beth Leigh : Well phrased - I added the good/bad fire idea to the spreadsheet.\\n10:55:53\\t From  Merritt Turetsky (she/her) : Christa - I was part of a working group that thought about the evolution of flammability traits and bryophytes were pretty important to that story.  This was more global, but it would be awesome to drill into northern plants (vasc + nonvasc).\\n10:57:26\\t From  glennjuday   to   Jason Downing(Privately) : Yes, reboot worked.\\n10:57:45\\t From  Christa Mulder : Merritt - yes, it would. Also in terms of feedbacks to changes in composition. We\\'ve done some work showing that invasives, which thrive post-fire, can be both restricted and advanced by moss, depending on the species. \\n10:58:12\\t From  Mary Beth Leigh : Nitrogen is a limiting nutrient for plant growth in the boreal forest ecosystem. Jay Jones’ group is seeing that lots of N is flowing into streams and then being lost from the ecosystem as it washes away. Microbes may be converted dead organics into soluble forms of N that wash away. Thawing permafrost may be helping this happen in a larger quantity of soil.\\n10:58:33\\t From  Michelle Cailin Mack : Taliks are kind of like zombie fires—for microbes!\\n10:58:48\\t From  Mario Muscarella (he/him) : :)\\n10:59:51\\t From  William Cox : Merritt- I\\'d love to be involved with a bryo-microclimate-fire interaction story if there\\'s an opportunity.\\n11:00:31\\t From  Christa Mulder : Following up on Mary Beth: Nitrogen is a very big deal because it is limiting to almost every species: plants, animals, fungi, bacteria... they all need it to make protein and other components that are critical to life. The exception is bacteria that can take N out of the air, where it is very abundant. So any time there is a shift in where N goes, it matters. \\n11:00:37\\t From  Merritt Turetsky (she/her) : Michelle that is actually a really interesting analogy.  I am interested in these subsurface changes and important they are to surface processes.  This is sort of a test of our connectivity hypothesis.  I wonder if there are other examples….?\\n11:00:54\\t From  Teresa Hollingsworth : MRT and Christa- maybe the three of us can put together a “working group” on this. I would really like to see this be a bigger part of the next proposal\\n11:01:22\\t From  Helene Genet : Vladimir - is this talik development you showed in your first slide observed at the BNZ bore hole site?\\n11:01:23\\t From  Mary Beth Leigh : The active layer of soil is the surface layer that usually thaws in summer and refreezes in winter. Romanovsky is finding that it’s stopped freezing in the winter in 2017-2020 for the first time since monitoring started in 1995.\\n11:01:28\\t From  Teresa Hollingsworth : Christa- YES! The phenology part is my “future” thinking. And it would be great to think more about life history traits of the two species we looked at. We looked at Vaculi and Hylocomium and measured traits across a variety of sites and then linked them to environmental gradients\\n11:01:33\\t From  Merritt Turetsky (she/her) : Yes!  And we have a moss loving PhD student (Will) to help!\\n11:01:59\\t From  Christa Mulder : Teresa, Merritt, William, sounds like a great topic for a follow-up conversation!\\n11:02:25\\t From  Jessie Robertson : Sounds like an open area of research\\n11:03:21\\t From  Merritt Turetsky (she/her) : @Jessie - we use bryophyte species change as an indication of talik formation and early thaw (prior to thermokarst formation).  The mosses are the Lorax of change!  This is Will Cox’ thesis work.  Vlad, this might work in some areas and not others I recognize.\\n11:03:48\\t From  Teresa Hollingsworth : I love to hear of Moss loving PhD students!\\n11:03:50\\t From  Jessie Robertson : Very cool! I wonder about the isotopic trace gas signature emitting from these areas...\\n11:04:10\\t From  Jessie Robertson : if there a signature we can observe\\n11:04:49\\t From  Mary Beth Leigh   to   Jason Downing(Privately) : Hi Jason! Artists are asking if we’ll have access to the saved chat.\\n11:05:40\\t From  Mary Beth Leigh   to   Jason Downing(Privately) : PS you’re doing an awesome job\\n11:08:40\\t From  Michelle Cailin Mack : Whose roots and mycorrhiza are exploiting taliks?\\n11:09:02\\t From  Jessie Robertson : I\\'ve looked at plant water uptake in response to talik development\\n11:09:37\\t From  Jason Downing   to   Mary Beth Leigh(Privately) : It should be captured automatically but I will try to copy it as well\\n11:09:37\\t From  Michelle Cailin Mack : Are there roots exploring taliks?\\n11:09:55\\t From  Jessie Robertson : There\\'s more work that can be done, but the plants will exploit the space. There\\'s not a ton of roots down there but enough to access the water that becomes availble\\n11:09:59\\t From  Jessie Robertson : available\\n11:10:21\\t From  Jessie Robertson : which is important particularly in dry years or dry periods\\n11:10:34\\t From  Michelle Cailin Mack : Is talik water isotopically different than frozen water?\\n11:11:06\\t From  Jessie Robertson : there is enough variability to partition water sources\\n11:11:27\\t From  Jessie Robertson : I\\'ll need to remind myself of the level of variation\\n11:11:28\\t From  Michelle Cailin Mack : Cool! Or really, warm!\\n11:12:00\\t From  Mary Beth Leigh : Nice flower-shaped conceptual diagram, Merritt!\\n11:12:50\\t From  ursel schuette : Following Mary Beth & Christa Mulder: is part of the nitrogen limitation offset by increased microbial activity with permafrost thaw making nitrogen more available? Obviously the washing out of nitrogen into the river is a big shift in the nitrogen regime and is a rapid change.\\n11:13:49\\t From  Teresa Hollingsworth : MRT/TB: I know we talked about this when NASA AboVE first got funded, but it seems like there is definitely native knowledge that should be incorporated about permafrost thaw. I remember distinctly Caroline Brown talking about an elder in maybe? Koyukuk that has been monitoring changes in permafrost for 30/40 years.\\n11:16:08\\t From  Merritt Turetsky (she/her) : I would love this.  We have learned a lot from local and traditional knowledge in the Northwest Territories.  Most of this has focused on changes in fishing areas and I think Todd has heard similar stories from elders in Alaska.  Another type of teleconnection perhaps….\\n11:16:23\\t From  Mary Beth Leigh : Ursel, that’s a good question. Maybe Jay and Tamara or others can help.\\n11:16:23\\t From  Rebecca Eliza Hewitt : Let’s have a breakout group on fungal qSIP!\\n11:17:18\\t From  Mary Beth Leigh : Yes on qSIP!\\n11:17:26\\t From  Michelle Cailin Mack : We might need to be more inclusive!  Bacteria and archea, too!\\n11:17:29\\t From  Mary Beth Leigh : Translation: GHG = greenhouse gases\\n11:22:20\\t From  Mary Beth Leigh : Translation from MC Leewis, coauthor with Waldrop: current permafrost carbon storage (no matter the age) is dependent on both microbial communities which are active below freezing over millennia and the climate present at the time of permafrost formation\\n11:24:32\\t From  Michelle Cailin Mack : How do microbes that live below freezing experience time?\\n11:25:15\\t From  msluc : covid time\\n11:25:35\\t From  Christa Mulder : In that case I feel sorry for them...\\n11:27:19\\t From  Mary Beth Leigh : Genet is finding that wet sites (lowlands, wetlands) are getting wetter and dry sites (uplands) are getting drier.\\n11:27:26\\t From  Mario Muscarella (he/him) : As long as they can meet their minimal energetic requirements: microbes can survive for extremely long periods of time. In lab experiments with soil isolates, we have found stable survival (maintained viability) in starvation conditions for 4+ yrs\\n11:30:08\\t From  MC Leewis (USGS) : Using SIP we see evidence that microbes are generally happy (although sloooow growing) despite populations being in permafrost since the Pleistocene. Certainly the older the permafrost, the fewer intact cells, the slower the activity, and the lower the microbial biomass.\\n11:31:44\\t From  mark waldrop : Microbes in permafrost experience time very slowly of course.  Microbial turnover (replacement of biomass) may be 0.25/yr below freezing and 3 to 4/yr at 5C. Seasonal is another matter. They may have seasonal dynamics in ice but hasn’t been looked at yet\\n11:32:32\\t From  Theresa Woldstad : Southeast Alaska would be an interesting area to discuss changing landscapes in terms of yellow cedar die-offs. \\nThe die-off is \\nTraditionally, artists would harvest bark from historical sites that belonged to the clan. As logging roads increased in the Tongass Forest, artists were able to travel father into old growth forests and expand their ranges for harvest. Yet, die-offs have impacted several of these modern harvest locations as well as the traditional historical sites.\\n11:33:10\\t From  Brian Buma : there are lots of culturally modified trees and practices that are still alive and well on the Tongas, we\\'ve done a lot with yellow-cedar decline\\n11:34:11\\t From  Brian Buma : we\\'ve been tracking migration of YC and redcedar - we found a stand of redcedar far from the village that people would trek to just for the bark.  there\\'s a lot of knowledge in those communities re: the artistic tradition\\n11:34:40\\t From  Merritt Turetsky (she/her) : Hi microbial peeps, how important is microbial recruitment/migration?  Should we be thinking about this as hydrologic connectivity changes both surface and subsurface?\\n11:34:51\\t From  Mary Beth Leigh : Interesting, Theresa and Brian. I wonder if there are similar trends in interior forests and trees used for artistic/cultural practices.\\n11:34:52\\t From  Brian Buma : yellow-cedar mortality due to snow loss rarely kills all the trees (usually about 70-80% of basal area) but the responsible bark harvesters won\\'t overharvest, so that\\'s squeezing supply\\n11:36:44\\t From  Merritt Turetsky (she/her) : Thanks Catherine!  Go APEX!\\n11:36:58\\t From  Michelle Cailin Mack   to   Jason Downing(Privately) : Is Knute out?\\n11:36:59\\t From  William Cox : Whoo! APEX!\\n11:37:38\\t From  Teresa Hollingsworth : MB: One thing that is interesting is that in the interior, fire burned trees are often used for furniture and the like, so the relationship is complicated. If we have an increase in fires we might get more usable trees. But not if too severe\\n11:37:52\\t From  Jason Downing   to   Michelle Cailin Mack(Privately) : I think so unless Derek is here now but I think I goofed and he needed to go earlier because of a class.  sorry\\n11:37:58\\t From  MC Leewis (USGS) : Merritt - as permafrost thaws, I think microbial recruitment becomes really important. For example: In old (>33Ka) permafrost there’s a pool of labile C but no methanogens. Which microbes are recruited and how the permafrost thaws (e.g. gradual/inundated vs. abrupt) could have major impacts on the kind of C emitted as flux.\\n11:38:08\\t From  Mario Muscarella (he/him) : @Merritt: this is a very important topic and something we should all be working to address better. There is very strong evidence for migration from terrestrial to aquatic habitats, but some of our data shows that only select groups are recruited. Most are transient. But still a need to understand which group and why .\\n11:38:33\\t From  Michelle Cailin Mack : The island biogeography of taliks\\n11:38:41\\t From  Mario Muscarella (he/him) : Yes please!\\n11:39:08\\t From  MC Leewis (USGS) : Agreed! so cool (pun intended?)! :)\\n11:39:09\\t From  Merritt Turetsky (she/her) : Fascinating Mario!  I think this is another grand challenge.  Thaw bogs and lakes truly are an awesome test of island biogeography but also meta-community (meta-ecosystem?) theories.\\n11:39:36\\t From  ursel schuette : @Merritt and @Mario @ MC: who is recruited may also depend on the environment the migrating microbes are passing by. So it is the environment suitable, can the microbes establish there\\n11:39:37\\t From  Katie Craney : For further cultural understanding of yellow cedar and die off, look for “In Search of the Canary Tree” a book by Lauren E. Oakes\\n11:39:56\\t From  Brian Buma : Yes, excellent read by Lauren, good suggestion.  \\n11:40:02\\t From  MC Leewis (USGS) : Stay tuned for a synthesis topic on microbial recruitment to permafrost that Jessica Ernakovich is leading as a part of the PCN\\n11:40:21\\t From  Mario Muscarella (he/him) : There is probably a good link between hydrologic connectivity and the migration/recruitment. Some interesting experiments could be developed to address this directly\\n11:41:18\\t From  William Cox : Especially interesting considering we may see a lot more hydrological connectivity as ice-rich permafrost thaws.\\n11:41:48\\t From  Merritt Turetsky (she/her) : This is fascinating and I think another grand challenge in terms of whether this is key to fate of thawing permafrost C and even fate of permafrost N\\n11:43:23\\t From  Mario Muscarella (he/him) : Due to the Reynolds number experienced by microbes, the recruitment of new surfaces during hydrologic flow will depend on water residence time. So as Ursel mentioned: soil conditions will have a huge impact\\n11:43:48\\t From  Mary Beth Leigh : Yes, Merritt, Mario, etc. that’d be great if you can add these to the grand challenge sheet! https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hWJTM6cgUi2sRjPH27gLqbcdOQdoHALX/view?usp=sharing\\n11:45:10\\t From  William Cox : Possible interactions too with concurrent changes in microclimate, veg,  and soil matrix as P-frost thaws and deeper rooting plants may colonize and oxidize previously reduced soils\\n11:48:38\\t From  Brian Buma : Roger - is there any major relationship between basal area and susceptibility to the infection?\\n11:49:25\\t From  Christa Mulder : Roger, your talk made me think back to Jenny Rohr\\'s work, where she found very different impacts of experimental infection in late summer vs. early fall in aspen.  I wonder how much the immune system responses of alder differ by time of year.\\n11:49:55\\t From  Helene Genet : Roger - from our soil moisture analysis: summer precipitation has veery little influence on soil moisture, but ET:PET (Modis estimates) shows much better correlation with soil moisture variations.\\n11:50:42\\t From  Roger Ruess : Brian - yes stands with higher aspen basal area have higher incidence of canker\\n11:51:12\\t From  Michelle Cailin Mack : Density dependent disease dynamics?\\n11:51:24\\t From  Roger Ruess : Christa - yes, we think aspen are much more vulnerable to successful pathogen growth when they are infected in the fall - after photosynthesis is shut down\\n11:52:06\\t From  Roger Ruess : yes, density dependence - but not in young stands where RGR, defenses and the immune system are strongly upregulated\\n11:52:41\\t From  Mary Beth Leigh : Translation: On aspen trees with leaf-miner damage, the undamaged leaves work harder to compensate. This provides some growth resilience. But, there are still unknowns as to how the trees fully compensate.\\n11:54:18\\t From  Brian Buma : Interesting.  Kate Hayes data (I presented some of it, her paper will be out soon) have shifts to higher aspen density w/ 3 fires in short interval.  Only a relatively few number of sites but that\\'s a new implication we hadn\\'t really considered yet\\n11:54:28\\t From  Roger Ruess : Helene - yes, by mid summer when trees are dominating water budgets, its not surprising that there is a low sensitivity of soil moisture to ppt\\n11:56:02\\t From  Roger Ruess : Brian - I\\'ll send you the aspen canker paper when I send it back to the AE next week.  I\\'d like to see Kate\\'s Ecosphere paper\\n11:56:32\\t From  Brian Buma : Sounds good.  Love to read it.\\n11:57:25\\t From  Brian Buma : bear baiting has impacted our study sites.  pain in the butt.  very friendly bears though.\\n11:58:26\\t From  Michelle Cailin Mack : Do people kill and eat the baited bears?\\n11:59:55\\t From  Jason Downing   to   Michelle Cailin Mack(Privately) : yes\\n12:00:04\\t From  Jason Downing   to   Michelle Cailin Mack(Privately) : and wear them\\n12:01:41\\t From  Merritt Turetsky (she/her) : Amazing Mary Beth.  We are seeing increased focus of AI in Arctic science and policy.
